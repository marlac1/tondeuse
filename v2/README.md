<h2>GOAL</h2>
An input file provides the following datas : the surface of an area, the initial position and orientation of mowers and instructions to move them. The program aims to return mower's final position and orientation. 

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requirements : python 3.9</li>
<li>Inside the project's v2 folder, execute the program "test_updated.py" with "input.txt" argument : <i> $python test_updated.py input.txt </i>. "Test_updated.py" is the last version (v2) of my answer to the technical test.</li>
<li>You will find the output of the program in the terminal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ALGO :</h2>
I divided the program into two classes representing the mower "TondeuseUpdated" and input datas "InputDatasUpdated".
Once extracted from the file and cleaned, datas are used as attributes of the mower object.
Several methods are processed among this object to return its final position and orientation.
